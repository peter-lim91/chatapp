# chatapp

A chatapp I create to learn more about Express.js and websockets. 

Vanilla javascript and html used for the front end, and styled to emulate a terminal interface with a typewriter effect.
Express used for the back end as a websocket server.

Currently hosted at https://superuniquechatapp.herokuapp.com (it may take a few seconds to spin up).
